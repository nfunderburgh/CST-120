			Hello my name is Noah Funderburgh. I'm 23 and lived in Portland, 
			Oregon most of my life but have I recently moved to Phoenix, AZ 
			because I got tired of the cold weather. I am transferring over 
			from Portland state university to GCU. I have my associates in computer 
			science and am currently working towards a bachelor's in software development. 
			A little about me is I am into video games, crypto, NFT's, and sports. 
			I have played video games for as long as I can remember. I play all 
			different types of games from fps to mmorpg's or even moba's depending 
			on how I am feeling. More recently I have got into crypto. From crypto
			 I got into NFT's which are essentially a form of digital art. 
			 I also love watching basketball in my free time even though I am terrible at it.</p>
