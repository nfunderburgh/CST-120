        <h2>Topic 7 Advanced Web Development </h2> 
        <p> In this topic, students learn that building static webpages has limits and that they
            often need to be deployed on web servers sometimes backed with a server-side programming
            language or database. This topic, at minimum, will introduce the students to the HTTP protocol,
            client server model, HTML forms, and how to implement forms processing to expand on the
            capabilities of the webpages they have built so far in previous topics. This topic introduces the
            students to the basic concepts required for future web application development courses where
            formal dynamic web application frameworks are used.</p>
